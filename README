Escape From Enceladus is an indie Metroidvania game for the PC and XBox360.

The game itself is under the "EscapeFromEnceladus" project. It requires XNA Game Studio and Visual Studio to build, and is only tested with a wired XBox360 USB controller on Windows 7.

This project includes a redistribution of the Farseer Physics Engine with a minor bug fix.
