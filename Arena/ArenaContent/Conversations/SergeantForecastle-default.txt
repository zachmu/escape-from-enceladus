SergeantForecastle: Professor Iapetus gives me the jibblies, Lieutenant.
SergeantForecastle: He's always making veiled threats about us veering off course,
SergeantForecastle: or hitting an asteroid, or getting space madness!
SergeantForecastle: At the academy they told us space madness was a myth!
SergeantForecastle: And the other guys are saying he's responsible for killing more people than Mecha-Hitler.
SergeantForecastle: But that's ridiculous. That record is untouchable.
SergeantForecastle: Why are we even taking him to Enceladus, any way?
SergeantForecastle: If it were my call, he'd take a long walk down a short air lock.
