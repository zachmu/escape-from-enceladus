LieutenantForecastle: Professor Iapetus gives me the jibblies, sir.
LieutenantForecastle: He's always making veiled threats about us veering off course,

LieutenantForecastle: At the academy they told us space madness was a myth!
LieutenantForecastle: And the other guys are saying he's responsible for killing more people than Mecha-Hitler.
LieutenantForecastle: But that's ridiculous. That record is untouchable.
LieutenantForecastle: Why are we even taking him to Enceladus, any way?
LieutenantForecastle: If it were my call, he'd take a long walk down a short air lock.
