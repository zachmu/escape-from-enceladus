EnsignGibe: Lieutenant Commander Roark!
Roark: Ensign Gibe. Is there a reason you're in the cargo hold at this hour?
EnsignGibe: I know it's not on the duty roster, sir.
EnsignGibe: It's just... I come here sometimes to just get away from the bustle of ship life, you know?
Roark: Bustle? There are a total of nine people on this ship.
EnsignGibe: Look, don't tell Captain Purchase I'm here, OK? I'll owe you one!
Roark: Alright, but I expect to see you signing up for double kitchen duty tomorrow, Ensign.
EnsignGibe: Thanks a lot, sir. I won't let you down!
