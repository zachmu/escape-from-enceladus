LieutenantForecastle: Professor Iapetus gives me the jibblies, sir.
LieutenantForecastle: He's always making thinly veiled threats about us veering off course, or hitting an asteroid, or getting space madness!
LieutenantForecastle: At the academy they told us space madness was a myth!
ProfessorIapetus: They thought the Higgs Boson was a myth, too!
Roark: Just ignore him. He seems to like the stun gas.
LieutenantForecastle: Why are we even taking him to Enceladus, any way?
LieutenantForecastle: If it were my call, he'd take a long walk down a short air lock.
Roark: You will carry out your orders as you have received them, Lieutenant.
LieutenantForecastle: Yes sir!
