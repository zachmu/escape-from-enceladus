EnsignLeeward: Captain, this is Ensign Leeward at the helm.
CaptainPurchase: Go ahead, Ensign.
EnsignLeeward: We're fast approaching the colony on Enceladus. I hailed them but there was no response.
CommanderTaffrail: Captain, this is Commander Taffrail. I'm picking up some novel radioactive signatures coming from the colony.
CommanderTaffrail: It's in a very exotic bandwidth, and it almost seems like some kind of code...
ChiefMizzen: Captain, we've lost engine power!
EnsignLeeward: We're still headed directly for the surface of Enceladus.
CaptainPurchase: What?! Get us back online immediately, Chief Mizzen!
ChiefMizzen: We need to think of other options, sir! We are a no-go in engineering!
CaptainPurchase: Ensign Gibe, how much time until impact?
EnsignLeeward: Um, about... it's hard to say, exactly, sir.
CaptainPurchase: I need answers now, Ensign.
EnsignLeeward: I didn't want to say anything before, but astrogation is down as well. We're flying blind.
CommanderTaffrail: Captain, both failures coincided with the strange radiation from the colony.
CaptainPurchase: A trap! Damn your eyes, Iapetus!
CaptainPurchase: Any thoughts, Lieutenant Commander?
Roark: We could look out the windshield, I guess.
CaptainPurchase: That's a terrible idea. And it doesn't help without engine power.
ChiefMizzen: Captain, I've managed to jury-rig a backup-backup system. I can get us just a trickle of power.
CaptainPurchase: Is it enough to land with?
ChiefMizzen: Not gently, but yes.
CaptainPurchase: I can't believe I'm saying this, but look out the windshield, Lieutenant Commander. You'll need to estimate when to fire the engines.
Roark: Engineering, on my mark!
Roark: 3!
Roark: 2!
Roark: 1!
Roark: Mark!
