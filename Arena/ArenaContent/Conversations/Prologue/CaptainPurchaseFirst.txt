CaptainPurchase: At ease, Lieutenant.
CaptainPurchase: ... just right now, I mean. In general, keep your eyes open and your ears peeled!
Roark: Sir!
CaptainPurchase: As you know, we have been contracted to transport the criminally insane Professor Iapetus to the prison colony on Enceladus.
Roark: The moon of Saturn, sir?
CaptainPurchase: Don't interrupt, but obviously, yes.
CaptainPurchase: Iapetus has been sentenced to permanent exile on the satellite, where he will be supervised and allowed to complete some of his research that was deemed harmless.
CaptainPurchase: As the ship's security officer, I trust you feel up to guarding an unarmed pencil pusher?
Roark: An interesting challenge, sir!
CaptainPurchase: As you say, lieutenant.
CaptainPurchase: Please execute a security sweep of the ship, and make sure to talk to everyone.
CaptainPurchase: We don't want to overlook any subterfuge.
CaptainPurchase: Dismissed!
