ChefHawser: I didn't bring this up over the ship radio like the other officers...
ChefHawser: I'm embarrassed to even ask, really...
Roark: Spit it out, Chef!
ChefHawser: Well, the thing is, I'm missing something from the kitchen!
ChefHawser: I had a big juicy ham that I was going to serve for our return voyage.
ChefHawser: But it vanished! Just like all that other equipment!
ChefHawser: I know it's not as important as getting our engines running again, but if you manage to track down that ham, I would make it worth your while.
