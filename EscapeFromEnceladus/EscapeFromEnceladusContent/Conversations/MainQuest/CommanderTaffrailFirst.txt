CommanderTaffrail: As your commanding officer, I feel the need to tell you...
CommanderTaffrail: You know that I would go out there in your place, but your nanomech suit is keyed to your genome alone.

CommanderTaffrail: Let me know as soon as you find that missing antenna unit! The sooner we get it repaired, the sooner we can signal for help.
Roark: Roger that, commander. I won't let you down!
